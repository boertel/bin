# My Tools #

## CSS ##

### cssclean ###
Look in your html and js files and show you each css class not found (It doesn't mean not use, it's not a perfect system). You can remove the class on the fly.

### cssprop ###
Look for css classes that have the same properties. It doesn't modify your files, just inspect them.

## Others ##

### DCSwitch for DotCloud Swicth ###
Allow you to manage multiple dotcloud (http://www.dotcloud.com) accounts on the same computer and switch easily between them.

### Garbage ###
Look for "garbage" code on your source code (like "print" in python or "console.log" in javascript).

### git-uu ###
Open in MacVim all the conflicted files (when using git)

### Rename ###
Suppose to rename files with a regex but it's still almost empty.
